## Design Decisions

We will follow a straight forward design language. Its good, if you go through the current code by either forking or cloning the repository. We strongly suggest to stick with the current design guidelines. We will be updating this guide with more detailed guidelines & boilerplate code if possible.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for SkillUP. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](#bug-issue-template), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Make sure it is actually a bug before you create a issue 
* Note down the trail, on how the bug occurred.
* Do a small search and check if this issue has already been reported.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined what exactly your bug is related to, create an issue on the repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](#bug-issue-template).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

* **Are you able to reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

## Project Setup Instructions
  
  The first step to contributing to the code base is to set up your project.

### Set up Git

#### Install Git

##### For Linux Systems:

 Install git via your native package management system: ::

    $ yum install git

or::

    $ sudo apt-get install git

#### Windows and Mac OS X:

Download GitHub's software, which will install git with a nice GUI.

#### Configure Git Settings

To set user-name and email (replace them with your own)::

    $ git config user.name "Firstname Lastname"
    $ git config user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

The name should be your actual name, not your GitHub username.

#### Create Github Account

Now you should have a github account for contributing to the code base. If you don't have one already, then sign up [here](https://github.com/signup/free)
 
### Fork the Project

Create your own *fork* of the project (if you have not yet). Go to the project repository:

  * https://github.com/UdacityFrontEndScholarship/quiz-app
 
and click the “Fork” button.

Now you have your own repository for the project. If your username in GitHub is `nickname` then the address of the forked project will look something like:

  * https://github.com/nickname/quiz-app

### Clone the Project

On your computer browse to where you would like to keep the project, and clone (download) the latest
code from the original repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/UdacityFrontEndScholarship/quiz-app.git
    $ cd quiz-app


## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Proper & meaningful commit messages are the best way to keep code and organized.
* Always write a commit message, even if its for small change.
